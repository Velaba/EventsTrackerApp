*GETTING SARTED WITH CORE DATA*



-WHAT IS IS CORE DATA?-

UNLIKE OPTIONS LIKE CLOUDKIT, MYSQL, AND FIREBASE, CORE DATA IS NOT A REMOTE DATABASE SOLUTION
THIS MEANS OUR DATA IS STORED ON A REMOTE SERVER.
CORE DATA, HOWEVER, STORES DATA DIRECTLY ON DISK, MEANING THAT THIS IS NOT A GOOD OPTION FOR GENERATING USER ACCOUNTS.

CORE DATA IS USED WHEN YOU NEED DATA PERSISTENCE LOCALLLY, ON DEVICE.
THIS IS SIMILAR TO CODEABLE AND USER DEFAULTS/@APP STORAGE

CORE DATA IS NOT A DATABASE.
CORE DATA IS AN OBJECT GRAPH MANAGER.



-WHAT IS AN OBJECT GRAPH MANAGER?-

AN OBJECT GRAPH IS ESSENTIALLY A GROUP OF OBJECTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SAID OBJECTS.



-HOW DOES CORE DATA WORK?

CORE DATA WORKS WITH ENTITIES WHICH ACT LIKE CLASSES THAT HAVE ATTRIBUTES OF THAT ENTITY.
THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY LIKE PROPERTIES; CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES.
